<h2>About This Blog</h2>
<p>I don't like the label "retail quant", I'm just someone who's fascinated by markets and the interesting questions hidden in data. This blog is where I explore those questions through (hopefully) rigorous hypothesis testing and careful analysis.</p>
<p>My approach is <strong>research-first</strong>: the goal is to answer intellectually interesting questions about how markets work, not to find the next profitable trading strategy. I believe in forming explicit hypotheses before looking at data, testing them on proper out-of-sample periods, and being brutally honest when the results don't match expectations. To me, good research means being willing to publish null results and acknowledge limitations.</p>
<p>Outside of markets, I follow football and soccer, read, or playing chess/ some videogames. Though not explicitly tied to my research, these all definitely offer unique ways of thinking and questions I want to answer.</p>

<strong>Important:</strong> Nothing on this blog constitutes investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice. This is educational and research content only. Markets are complex, risky, and most strategies that look good in backtests fail in practice. Do your own research and consult qualified professionals before making any investment decisions.
